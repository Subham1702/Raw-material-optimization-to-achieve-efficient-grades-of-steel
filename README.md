# Raw-material-optimization-to-achieve-efficient-grades-of-steel
## Project Description:
### Business Problem:
The steel manufacturing industry faces significant challenges in identifying optimal combination of raw materials and energy inputs necessary to produce high-quality steel efficiently.
### Business Objective: 
Maximize steel quality, Minimize costs.
### Business Constraint: 
Minimize energy use.
### Business Success Criteria: 
Reduce the processing time by 50%.
### Economic Success Criteria: 
Achieve a cost saving of at least $1M.
## Business Solution:
I gathered research papers and relevant datasets, then conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a client-provided secondary dataset using MySQL and Python to gain initial insights into steel production materials, cycle-time, and electricity consumption. Leveraging Auto-EDA libraries, I automated the EDA process, quickly generating comprehensive visualizations and statistical insights. After cleaning the data, I used Power BI and generated interactive dashboards.
